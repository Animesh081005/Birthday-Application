    <string name="dogWishTrans">"Hello Dear,\n\nMy name is Dogo.\nBut you can call me anything you want.\n\nWell...\n\nYou might know me as I am from your neighbourhood. Me and my friends watch you everyday and make sure no one hurts you.\n\nYes, I am the same light brown coloured dog that sometimes follow you.\n\nYou know when I came to know that your birthday is coming soon, I wanted to wish you,But feared that you might run away thinking I am gonna bite you.\n\nThis wish is made possible because of a very strange phenomena.\n\nThere was this unusual boy who was wandering around your house on a cold evening. I hated him, so me and my friends decided to chase him down so that he never comes back ever. As we were running and following his scooty, all my friends slowly changed their minds and I was left alone in this manhunt. But I quitely followed him to his house and then when the moment came I barked my lungs out.\n\nHe was afraid but strangely and unbelievably we reached to a deal. He promised to make a translator for me. Yes. From bho bho to english.\n\nHe turned out to be a really nice guy. This is all because of him that I am sending my wishes and messages to my best and lovely friend.\n\nDon't ever worry, we are always near you to protect you and to spread our unconditional love.\n\nHave the Happiest Birthday ever.\n\nAnd as humans say, Gali waala sab dekh rha he. We gali waala are watching and protecting you forever.\n\n\nLove."</string>
